    "description": "<blockquote cite=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington\"><p>Now I want to talk about <em>how</em> they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use \"disrupt\" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense.</p>\n<p>The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company.</p>\n<p>That's it.</p>\n<p>That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because <em>they</em> are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"cite\">&mdash; <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington\">Cory Doctorow</a>, The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI</p>\n\n    <p>Tags: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cory-doctorow\">cory-doctorow</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-ethics\">ai-ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai\">ai</a></p>",
