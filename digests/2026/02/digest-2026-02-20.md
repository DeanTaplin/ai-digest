# AI Agent Daily Digest - February 20, 2026

> **Executive Summary**: Major release day with Google's Gemini 3.1 Pro targeting agentic workloads at half the price of Claude Opus 4.6. Production-focused content dominates: Anthropic shares prompt caching insights from Claude Code, Google releases Agent Development Kit (ADK), and PydanticAI tutorial shows how to build bulletproof agentic workflows. Critical security research exposes agent hijacking vulnerabilities affecting Qwen, GPT, and Gemini.

## 🏭 Production Use Cases

### [How Claude Code Uses Prompt Caching for Agentic Products](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/thariq-shihipar/)
Anthropic engineer Thariq Shihipar reveals how Claude Code's entire architecture is built around prompt caching to enable long-running agentic products. Prompt caching reuses computation from previous roundtrips, significantly decreasing latency and cost. At Claude Code, they monitor prompt cache hit rates so closely that they declare SEVs when rates drop too low, as it directly impacts their ability to offer generous rate limits.

**Why it matters**: First-hand insight into production optimization for agentic systems from one of the leading AI companies.

### [Google Releases Gemini 3.1 Pro: The Agentic AI Model](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/19/google-ai-releases-gemini-3-1-pro-with-1-million-token-context-and-77-1-percent-arc-agi-2-reasoning-for-ai-agents/)
Google's Gemini 3.1 Pro launches with 1 million token context, 77.1% ARC-AGI-2 reasoning score, and pricing at $2/M input tokens ($12/M output under 200K tokens). That's less than half the price of Claude Opus 4.6 with competitive benchmark scores. The model specifically targets "agentic" AI applications with improved reasoning stability, software engineering capabilities, and tool-use reliability.

**Why it matters**: Major price/performance shift in the agentic AI market. Simon Willison tested it with his famous pelican-on-bicycle benchmark and got excellent SVG generation (though with 5+ minute generation time on launch day).

### [Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Agent Development Kit](https://www.kdnuggets.com/building-production-ready-ai-agents-with-agent-development-kit)
Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) addresses a critical gap in the agentic AI ecosystem by providing a framework that simplifies construction and deployment of multi-agent systems. ADK focuses on production-readiness rather than experimentation, offering standardized patterns for agent orchestration, communication, and deployment.

**Why it matters**: As agentic systems move from prototypes to production, frameworks like ADK that prioritize reliability and deployment become essential infrastructure.

### [Build Bulletproof Agentic Workflows with PydanticAI](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/19/a-coding-implementation-to-build-bulletproof-agentic-workflows-with-pydanticai-using-strict-schemas-tool-injection-and-model-agnostic-execution/)
Comprehensive tutorial on building production-ready agentic workflows using PydanticAI with strict type schemas, dependency injection for tools, and model-agnostic execution. The approach prioritizes reliability over best-effort generation by enforcing typed outputs at every step, enabling safe interaction with external systems like databases without breaking execution.

**Why it matters**: Practical, code-focused guide for developers who need their AI agents to be reliable in production, not just impressive in demos.

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

### [LangChain Agent Builder: Using Memory](https://blog.langchain.com/how-to-use-memory-in-agent-builder/)
LangChain's Agent Builder now includes memory capabilities that allow agents to remember user feedback, corrections, and preferences across sessions. Every correction you make and preference you share becomes persistent, making the agent improve over time based on your specific use patterns.

**Why it matters**: Memory is a key differentiator for production agents—turning one-shot interactions into learning relationships.

## 🔒 Security

### [Agent Hijacking via Structured Template Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16958)
*Research paper* - Researchers introduce Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework that exploits how LLM agents use chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into retrieved content, attackers can cause role confusion and trick agents into executing malicious instructions. The team identified over 70 vulnerabilities in commercial products (Qwen, GPT, Gemini) that have been confirmed by vendors.

**Why it matters**: Critical security research for anyone building or deploying RAG-based agents. Shows that agent security requires defense against structural attacks, not just prompt injection.

## 🔬 Research & Optimization

### [Dynamic System Instructions Cut Agent Costs by 70%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17046)
*Research paper* - Instruction-Tool Retrieval (ITR) dynamically retrieves only minimal system-prompt fragments and necessary tools per step, rather than re-ingesting full instructions and tool catalogs each turn. Results: 95% reduction in per-step context tokens, 32% improvement in tool routing accuracy, and 70% cost savings. Enables agents to run 2-20x more loops within context limits.

**Why it matters**: Practical optimization technique for production agents. Savings compound with agent step count, making long-running autonomous agents viable.
