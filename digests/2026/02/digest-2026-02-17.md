# AI Agents Daily Digest — February 17, 2026

> **15 articles** curated from 1,316 collected | Focused on AI agents, agentic systems & practical developer insights

---

## Executive Summary

Today's digest is defined by three converging themes: **MCP adoption going mainstream**, **open-weight agentic models arriving**, and **multi-agent security emerging as a serious production concern**. Agoda open-sourcing a zero-code REST/GraphQL → MCP converter signals that MCP is now enterprise-grade infrastructure. Alibaba's Qwen3.5-397B-A17B is the first open-weight model built *specifically* for agents, with 1M context and native tool use. And new research on OMNI-LEAK shows that the orchestrator multi-agent pattern — the one most teams are shipping to production — has a critical class of prompt-injection vulnerability. A high-signal day across the board.

### How to Build Human-in-the-Loop Plan-and-Execute AI Agents with LangGraph and Streamlit
**Source:** MarkTechPost | **Published:** Feb 17, 2026

A hands-on tutorial showing how to build a human-in-the-loop travel booking agent using LangGraph and Streamlit. The system follows a plan-and-execute pattern where the agent reasons and drafts a structured plan, then deliberately pauses to present it to the user for approval before taking any real action. A practical pattern for safe, controllable agentic systems in production.

**Key insight:** The plan-and-execute pattern with an explicit approval gate is the simplest safe architecture for agentic systems that touch real resources.

### OMNI-LEAK: Multi-Agent Networks Can Be Compromised by a Single Prompt Injection
**Source:** arXiv (cs.AI) | **Published:** Feb 17, 2026

Security researchers demonstrate a novel attack vector against the orchestrator multi-agent pattern — a single indirect prompt injection can cascade across multiple sub-agents to leak sensitive data, even when data access controls are in place. Both reasoning and non-reasoning frontier models are found to be vulnerable. The attack is simple to execute and hard to defend against with current guardrails.

**Key insight:** The orchestrator pattern is the default multi-agent architecture — and it has a class of prompt injection vulnerability that current guardrails don't address. Teams shipping to production need to read this.
