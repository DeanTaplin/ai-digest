### LinkedIn's Agentic RL Training Retrospective
**Source:** [Hugging Face Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/LinkedIn/gpt-oss-agentic-rl)

LinkedIn publishes a practical retrospective on training open-source GPT models with agentic reinforcement learning. The post covers real challenges encountered, what worked, and lessons learned from training at scale.

**Key insight:** Production-scale agentic RL training has specific failure modes and solutions that differ from standard fine-tuning.

**Why it matters:** One of the few detailed, honest accounts of training agentic models at production scale from a major tech company.

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools

### MCP Servers Release 2026.1.26
**Source:** [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/releases/tag/2026.1.26)

New release of the official MCP server packages: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything`, `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`, and `mcp-server-time` all updated to version 2026.1.26.

**Key insight:** The MCP ecosystem continues steady maintenance cadence.

**Why it matters:** If you're building MCP-based agent integrations, staying current on server packages ensures compatibility.

### Haystack-Powered Multi-Agent Incident Response System
**Source:** [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/01/26/how-a-haystack-powered-multi-agent-system-detects-incidents-investigates-metrics-and-logs-and-produces-production-grade-incident-reviews-end-to-end/)

A hands-on tutorial demonstrating how to build a multi-agent system using Haystack that detects incidents, investigates metrics and logs, and produces production-grade incident reviews. The implementation covers orchestration, stateful decision-making, tool execution, and structured control flow.

**Key insight:** Modern agent frameworks like Haystack can express complex, multi-step incident response as clean, runnable pipelines.

**Why it matters:** Incident response is a high-value target for agent automation—this provides a concrete implementation pattern.

### Tips for Getting Coding Agents to Write Good Python Tests
**Source:** [Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/26/tests/)

Simon Willison shares practical advice on getting coding agents to write quality pytest tests. Key tips include leveraging Python's rich test ecosystem (pytest-httpx for mocking, snapshot testing), keeping tests visible to the agent, and actively reviewing agent-generated tests rather than blindly accepting them.

**Key insight:** The quality of agent-generated tests depends heavily on the testing ecosystem—Python's rich pytest culture gives agents better examples to learn from.

**Why it matters:** Testing is where coding agents can provide the most leverage but also where bad output is most dangerous. These practical tips help you get value without introducing false confidence.

### Ethan Mollick on Managing AI Agents Like Employees
**Source:** [Bluesky / One Useful Thing](https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3mdgan67v3s2b)

Ethan Mollick writes about his MBA class where students created startups in days using AI, arguing that the secret to working with AI agents is applying good management principles. The post explores how to build processes around delegating to AIs in a world where agents can handle multi-hour tasks.

**Key insight:** Managing agents effectively requires the same skills as managing people—clear delegation, defined outcomes, and appropriate oversight.

**Why it matters:** As agents take on longer, more autonomous tasks, the bottleneck shifts from technical implementation to management and process design.

### MLE-Ideator: Separating Ideation from Implementation in ML Agents
**Source:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17596)

Introduces a dual-agent framework that separates ideation from implementation for machine learning engineering tasks. An implementation agent can request strategic guidance from a dedicated Ideator agent, significantly outperforming single-agent approaches.

**Key insight:** Agent systems improve when strategic thinking is separated from execution—mirroring how human teams work.

**Why it matters:** The ideation/implementation split is a practical pattern that developers can apply to any multi-agent system, not just ML engineering.
