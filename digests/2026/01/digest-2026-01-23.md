### [TDFlow: 94.3% Pass Rate on SWE-Bench with Test-Driven Agent Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23761)
**Summary:** TDFlow frames software engineering as a test-resolution task where multi-agent systems solve human-written tests through coordinated patch proposal, debugging, and revision. The system achieved 94.3% pass rate on SWE-Bench Verified and 88.8% on SWE-Bench Lite with only 7 test-hacking instances across 800 runs.

**Key Insight:** The primary obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies in writing successful reproduction tests—suggesting human-LLM collaboration where developers write tests and AI systems solve them.

**Why It Matters:** This validates a practical development paradigm: developers focus on specification through tests while agents handle implementation. Teams can adopt this approach today by investing in test quality rather than prompt engineering.

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools

### [AgentSM: Semantic Memory Improves Agentic SQL Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15709)
**Summary:** AgentSM captures prior execution traces as structured programs that guide future reasoning, reducing the noise from repeated database interactions and inconsistent outputs. On Spider 2.0 Lite, the system achieves 44.8% accuracy while reducing token usage by 25% and trajectory length by 35% compared to state-of-the-art systems.

**Key Insight:** Storing interpretable execution patterns rather than raw scratchpads or vector-based retrieval enables more efficient and stable reasoning for complex SQL generation.

**Why It Matters:** Teams building database agents can significantly reduce costs and improve reliability by implementing structured semantic memory rather than traditional RAG approaches—particularly valuable for enterprise deployments with large schemas.

### [Aeon: Sub-Millisecond Memory Management for Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15311)
**Summary:** Aeon treats agent memory as a managed OS resource, using a neuro-symbolic episodic graph and SIMD-accelerated vector indexing to achieve <1ms retrieval latency. The Semantic Lookaside Buffer exploits conversational patterns for predictive caching while countering "Vector Haze"—disconnected facts lacking continuity.

**Key Insight:** Memory management for agents requires the same engineering rigor as OS memory management—treating it as structured, hierarchical resources rather than unstructured vector dumps.

**Why It Matters:** Developers building agents for extended interactions can adopt Aeon's architectural patterns to maintain episodic continuity without degrading reasoning quality as conversations grow.
