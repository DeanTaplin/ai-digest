### **Key Decision-Makers in Multi-Agent Debates**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.11040](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11040)

This paper investigates power dynamics in multi-agent debate systems: which agents actually drive decisions, and how can we identify them? The research finds that not all agents contribute equally—some dominate the debate outcome while others are essentially decorative.

**Why it matters**: As multi-agent debate becomes a popular pattern for improving LLM outputs (Society of Mind, AutoGen, CrewAI), understanding which agents matter helps optimize these systems. It also raises important questions about fairness and representation in agent ensembles.

**Key insight**: More agents ≠ better decisions. Understanding and optimizing the influence distribution in multi-agent systems is critical for both performance and interpretability.

### **HARNESS: Human-Agent Risk Navigation and Safety System**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.10810](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10810)

HARNESS introduces a proactive hazard detection system for human-agent collaboration, focusing on identifying and mitigating risks before they materialize. The framework monitors agent behavior for safety violations and intervenes when necessary.

**Why it matters**: As AI agents gain autonomy in critical domains (healthcare, autonomous vehicles, industrial control), proactive safety systems become essential. HARNESS represents a shift from reactive error handling to predictive risk management.

**Key insight**: The next generation of agent systems won't just execute tasks—they'll actively monitor for safety violations and intervene autonomously.

### **Exposing Weak Links in Multi-Agent Systems Under Adversarial Prompting**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.10949](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10949)

Researchers demonstrate that multi-agent systems have exploitable weak links: adversarial prompts can target specific agents to compromise the entire system. The paper identifies vulnerabilities in agent coordination and proposes mitigation strategies.

**Why it matters**: Multi-agent architectures expand the attack surface. If one agent in a chain can be compromised via prompt injection, the entire system fails. This research highlights the security challenges of scaling to multi-agent systems.

**Key insight**: Security in multi-agent systems isn't just about securing individual agents—it's about securing the coordination layer and identifying which agents are critical failure points.

### **Unsupervised Cycle Detection in Agentic Applications**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.10650](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10650)

This paper tackles a practical problem in agentic workflows: detecting infinite loops and cycles in agent execution without manual intervention. The proposed unsupervised method identifies when agents are stuck in repetitive patterns.

**Why it matters**: Agentic systems can enter infinite loops due to hallucination, poor planning, or adversarial inputs. Automated cycle detection prevents runaway execution costs and ensures agents fail gracefully rather than burning compute indefinitely.

**Key insight**: Production-ready agents need circuit breakers. Detecting and breaking cycles is essential for reliable autonomous operation.

### **Building the Web for Agents: A Declarative Framework**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.11137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11137)

Researchers propose a declarative framework for making web content agent-accessible. Rather than forcing agents to parse HTML like humans, the framework structures web content explicitly for programmatic consumption.

**Why it matters**: Most web content is designed for human consumption, making it difficult for agents to reliably extract information. A declarative framework for agent-friendly web content could accelerate web automation and information extraction use cases.

**Key insight**: The web wasn't built for agents. As agentic systems proliferate, we'll need new standards for making information programmatically accessible—think "RSS for AI agents."

## 🛡️ Security & Safety

### **The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.10704](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)

This paper proposes a framework for managing "ethical entropy" in autonomous systems—the tendency for AI agents to drift from aligned behavior over time as they adapt and learn. The authors argue for active control mechanisms to maintain ethical constraints during autonomous operation.

**Why it matters**: As agents gain autonomy and adaptive capabilities, ensuring they remain aligned with human values becomes harder. Static alignment (RLHF during training) may not hold as agents learn from real-world interactions. This research explores how to maintain alignment dynamically.

**Key insight**: Alignment isn't a one-time problem—it's an ongoing control challenge. Autonomous agents need active ethical constraint enforcement, not just pre-deployment alignment.

### **BadThink: Triggered Overthinking Attacks on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**

**Source**: [ArXiv:2511.10714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10714)

Researchers demonstrate a new attack vector: triggering excessive reasoning loops in chain-of-thought LLMs to waste compute and degrade performance. The attack exploits the reasoning process itself, causing models to overthink simple problems.

**Why it matters**: Chain-of-thought reasoning is a core component of many agentic systems. Attacks that weaponize the reasoning process highlight vulnerabilities in inference-time compute optimization—you can DOS an agent by making it think too hard.

**Key insight**: Inference-time reasoning creates new attack surfaces. As agents spend more compute on reasoning, adversaries can exploit that to degrade performance or inflate costs.
