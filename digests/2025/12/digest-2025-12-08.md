## Production Use Cases

### WhatsApp's WhatsCode: 25 Months of Agentic AI at Scale
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05314) | Meta

WhatsApp's engineering team published detailed findings from their 2-year deployment of WhatsCode, an AI development system supporting 2+ billion users. The system evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with DevOps.

**Key metrics**: 3.5x improvement in privacy verification coverage (15%→53%), 3,000+ accepted code changes, 692 automated refactors, 86% precision in bug triage. Two collaboration patterns emerged: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60%) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%).

**Why it matters**: This is rare public data on large-scale agentic AI in production. The finding that "organizational factors are as decisive as technical capabilities" validates what many teams are discovering—human-AI collaboration patterns, not full automation, drive sustainable impact.

OpenAI and Instacart launched the first fully integrated grocery shopping experience in ChatGPT, including Instant Checkout payments. Users can now discover recipes, build shopping carts, and complete purchases without leaving the chat interface.

**Why it matters**: This represents a significant evolution in AI agent capabilities—moving from simple task delegation to end-to-end transaction completion. It demonstrates how major brands are building trust in AI-mediated commerce.

### Trusted AI Agents in the Cloud: Omega Platform
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05951) | Multi-institutional research

Omega provides end-to-end isolation for AI agents in cloud environments using Confidential VMs and GPUs. The system addresses trust across multi-party ecosystems where agents access sensitive data, invoke external tools, and interact with other agents.

**Key insight**: Uses nested isolation to host multiple agents within single CVMs, differential attestation for cross-principal trust, and policy frameworks governing data access and tool usage. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100.

**Why it matters**: As AI agents become services that autonomously handle sensitive operations, security and trust infrastructure becomes critical. Omega demonstrates practical approaches to policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.

## Trends & Analysis

### OpenAI's 2025 Enterprise AI Report
[Article](https://openai.com/index/the-state-of-enterprise-ai-2025-report) | OpenAI

OpenAI released their enterprise data showing accelerating AI adoption, deeper integration, and measurable productivity gains across industries in 2025. The report highlights how organizations are moving from experimentation to systematic deployment.

**Why it matters**: Real enterprise adoption data is scarce. This report provides visibility into how AI agents and LLM applications are performing in production environments across sectors.

### How Oxide Thinks About LLMs: A Values-First Framework
[RFD](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576) | Oxide Computer

Oxide published internal guidance on LLM use, grounded in their core values: responsibility, rigor, empathy, teamwork, and urgency. They're explicit about where LLMs help (reading comprehension, editing, debugging) and where they don't (writing prose, production code generation).

**Key principle**: "Human judgement remains firmly in the loop"—employees own output regardless of automation. They note that disclosing LLM use can paradoxically erode trust by distancing authors from responsibility.

**Why it matters**: As organizations develop LLM policies, Oxide's thoughtful framework shows how to balance productivity with intellectual integrity. Their prohibition on wholesale LLM-generated prose stems from social contracts with readers, not technical limitations.

## Developer Resources

### Top 5 Open-Source LLM Evaluation Platforms
[Article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/top-5-open-source-llm-evaluation-platforms) | KDnuggets

A practical roundup of open-source tools for testing, tracking, and improving LLM application performance. Essential reading for teams building production LLM applications who need systematic evaluation frameworks.

**Why it matters**: Evaluation infrastructure is often overlooked in early LLM projects but becomes critical as applications scale. These platforms help teams move from ad-hoc testing to systematic quality assurance.

## Research Highlights

### Extended Reality for Agentic Robots (XR-DT)
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05270) | Multi-institutional research

XR-DT framework combines physical and virtual spaces for human-robot interaction, integrating VR/AR/MR layers with real-time sensor data and Unity simulation. Includes AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination for dynamic task handling.

**Why it matters**: Demonstrates how multi-agent frameworks like AutoGen are being applied beyond software to physical robotics, with emphasis on interpretable, trustworthy human-robot collaboration.
